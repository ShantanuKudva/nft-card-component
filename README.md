# nft-card-component

Hey coder!
    So, this is my first repo on GitHub and right now, i decided to give it a go by working on a project which is present on FrontEndMentor.io
    
    This project is about building an NFT card with active states animation. It primarily focuses on CSS and its a good pooject to work on, to refresh your css basics
    and this is taking a bit longer than i expected because this is my first project without referring to any tutotials (if searching on Google dosen't count)
